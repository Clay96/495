What did I do over the summer? Overall, I didnâ€™t do many interesting things besides work. 
The only fun things I did was go to a few concerts and hang out with old high school friends. 
I made a lot of money from working 11 hrs/day, but sadly most of that was blown on 3 college books. 
I am quite happy to be back at college and plan on enjoying my final 1.5 years here.
