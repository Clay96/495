What did I do over the summer? Overall, I didnâ€™t do many interesting things besides work. 
The only fun things I did was go to a few concerts and hang out with old high school friends. 
I made a lot of money from working 11 hrs/day, but sadly most of that was blown on 3 college books. 
I am quite happy to be back at college and plan on enjoying my final 1.5 years here.

What did i do over the summer? Over the summer I was able to go on a trip to California which was pretty cool.
I got to see LA and the surrounding area. I also did my fair share of working for most of the summer. This was
also the first summer I lived in Muncie.

What did I do over the Summer? I spent most of the summer working to pay for tuition. I did spend some time 
hanging out with friends. I was able to go to the Newfields museum in Indianapolis which was very interesting.
